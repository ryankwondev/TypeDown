\section{Conclusions}

We have presented three new network architectures in detail:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Inception-ResNet-v1: a hybrid Inception version that has a
    similar computational cost to Inception-v3
    from~\cite{szegedy2015rethinking}.
  \item Inception-ResNet-v2: a costlier hybrid Inception version with
    significantly improved recognition performance.
  \item Inception-v4: a pure Inception variant without residual connections
    with roughly the same recognition performance as Inception-ResNet-v2.
\end{itemize}

We studied how the introduction of residual connections leads to dramatically
improved training speed for the Inception architecture. Also our latest models
(with and without residual connections) outperform all our previous networks,
just by virtue of the increased model size.
